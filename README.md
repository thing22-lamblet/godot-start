1.  get extra monitor working?
    - Adam's laptop USB-C does not seem to drive the portable
      monitor, so it needs power and HDMI mini.
2.  get integrated source code:
    A: not yet.  The git plugin is broken for godot 4.1, see
    https://github.com/godotengine/godot-git-plugin/issues/196

3.  Can we integrate git-bash?
   Seems like there might be a plugin?  Not clear
