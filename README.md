Adam and Dad are working this Godot tutorial:
	https://youtu.be/S8lMTwSRoRg?si=iBcpKu1rdQQES5Ya&t=3585

1.  get extra monitor working?
	- Adam's laptop USB-C does not seem to drive the portable
	  monitor, so it needs power and HDMI mini.
2.  get integrated source code:
	A: not yet.  The git plugin is broken for godot 4.1, see
	https://github.com/godotengine/godot-git-plugin/issues/196

3.  Can we integrate git-bash?
   Seems like there might be a plugin?  Not clear
